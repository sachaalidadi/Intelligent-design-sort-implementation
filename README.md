# Intelligent-design-sort-implementation

## About this repo

This repository is the first implementation in Python of the intelligent design sort.

The intelligent design sort states that there is a small chance that a list is in that exact order. Therefore, it must have been created by an intelligent sorter. But we, mortals, can't understand this transcendant sorting, and making any changes would make it less sorted.
